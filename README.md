Computational Modelling of Glucose Uptake in the Enterocyte
===========================================================

In this repository I have a fork of the model presented in: https://doi.org/10.36903/physiome.13034423.
The fork is made from the PMR workspace used in that publication: https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/572.
The goal of this fork is to have a play at getting something that provides a useful first-step tutorial for integrating things into tools based on the [SimulationVuer component](https://github.com/ABI-Software/simulationvuer) developed for the [SPARC Portal](https://sparc.science/), such as https://nickerso.github.io/simvuer/#/.
